# EMA-from-TT284 by Krzysztof Szumko

This is my (E)nd of (M)odule (A)ssignment for TT284 module for Open University.
This is not an entire EMA paper, just the answer to question 2b.

Question for this particular assignment was:
2(b) Responsive form

This question is about the admin application.

Some members of the admin team are interested in the possibility of carrying out some admin tasks using a mobile device; for example, while they are on a walk. They would like to see how the admin application might be presented on a mobile device.

Your task is to copy your solution to 2(a) and amend the CSS and HTML as appropriate to present the same form on a smartphone-sized screen.

    Use techniques you have learnt in Block 3 to allow the page layout to respond to screen width, such that the form is also usable on a 375px wide screen.
    No changes to functionality are required, but you may consider HTML5 inputs even if you did not use these in your 2(a) solution.
    The page and form should continue to be accessible.
    Take care not to change your 2(a) solution files.
    The web page and any related files should be clearly named e.g. q2b.html, q2b.css.

Your 2(b) solution should work at two screen widths: 375px and 1024px (“Mobile M” and “Laptop” in Chrome’s Device Toolbar); your solution need not respond to widths between the two.

Hint: Page layout on screens of this size are typically a single column, with the most useful or commonly used content or functionality presented sooner. For forms, labels are often presented above inputs rather than to their left. The file emaMobileResources.zip provides an example of some HTML and CSS that responds in this way which you can adapt if you wish.

Validate your HTML using the validator at https://validator.w3.org

In your solution document, provide a screenshot of the part of the page that shows the line ‘Document checking completed’ and the tags within the <head> tag of your source code just below.

Collect the files that make up your 2(a) and 2(b) solutions into a single ZIP archive, retaining any folder structure that you may have created. Please name the file using your own OUCU ‘OUCU_Q2.zip’.
